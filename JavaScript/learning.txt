    id can be used by only one HTML elements.

CSS : Cascading style sheet.
Date: Aug 21 2021.

:) CSS selectors:
    simple selectors (id, classes)

:) insert CSS:
    i) external CSS
    ii) internal CSS
    iii) inline CSS

:) cascading order-
    inline has highest priority.
    

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Javascript:
:) document.write should not be used after html document is loaded
    because it will delete the all existing html elements.
    It should be used for testing purpose.

:) re-defining the variable will not lose the value (if it is defined using var but 
    if it is define using let as it is not allowed.).

:) let keyword provide block scope to variable and var keyword provide global scope to 
    variable with in the {}.

:) let b = 20;
    // b = 20;
    {
        let b = 30;
        // b=30;
    }

    // b=20

:) Hoisting in java script is interesting. (it shouold happen with var keyword)
    {
        car = "Nano";
        var car;
    }

:) const keyword:
    i) it can't be redeclared.
    ii) it can't be reassigned.
    iii) it have block scope like let.

:) const work as var in terms of Hoisting.

:) javascript datatypes are dynamic.
    var a = 10;
    a = "Hello"';

:) javascript interpreter works from left to right.
    "ans" + 10 + 20 = "ans1020"
    10 + 20 + "ans" = "30ans"

:) NaN: not a number.
:) Javascript: Objects: It uses named indexes
                arrays: It uses number indexes.

:) Javascript function can called before its declaration.
    but not applicable for function defined using expression.

:) self invoking function:
    (
        function (){
            console.log("Hello World");
        }
    )();

:) arrows function
    const x  = (x, y) => x*y;

:) in javascript we can also store function and objects in variables.
    and if value assign to variable which is not declared it will becomes automatic global variable.

:) javascript nested function
