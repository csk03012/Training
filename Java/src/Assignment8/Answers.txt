2) JSON vs XML
    i) JSON: javascript object notation, XML: eXtensible markup language
    ii) One of the main differences is that the JSON can use arrays but XML cannot.
    iii) And XML use end tag (</>) but JSON does not.
    iv) In XML, key 'name' is enclosed in <> (open) and </> (closed) and values do
        not use any of those while in JSON, key 'name' and values (both) is enclosed
        in double quotes "".

3) DTD (Document Type Declaration) is a way to describe the XML data which defines
   the structure and legal elements and attributes of an XML document.

4) It is used for representing an item of data within the XML document.

5) Data present in XML file (well formed) is instance document.


6) JSON:
   i) Javascript object notation.
   ii) It is basically text based format used to transmit ans store data,
       it represents string format(text) of structured data based on
       javascript object syntax.
   iii) It is used when data is sent from server to a webpage or vice-versa.

7) Serialization in JSON: It means converting an object into string.
                          JSON.stringify() to serialize.
   Deserialization in JSON: reverse of serialization, converts string into object.
                            JSON.parse() to deserialize.

8) JSON.stringify() skipped some properties which are JS-specific:
   Functions (method)
   Symbolic keys and values
   keys that store undefined.

   Example: object -> {func(){alert("java")},
                       key1: undefined,
                       [Symbol("No.")]: 11}
            using JSON.stringify
            string -> '{}'
            In this example everything is ignored.

9) JSON vs JSONP
    i) JSONP stand for JSON with padding.
    ii) JSONP is JSON with extra code, it is like function call wrapped around
        the data (JSON) means put a string at the beginning and a pair of parenthesis
        around it.
    iii)JSON is used to transmit data from one server to another server while JSONP is used for
        transmit data to another domain.

10) JSON.stringify()
    It is Javascript function which convert Javascript object into string.
    Example: object -> {first: "text", second:23, third: true}
             string -> "{"first": "text", "second": 23, "third": true}"
    It is just opposite of JSON.parse() which converts JSON string into Javascript
     object, if JSON is derived from array it converts into Javascript array.
